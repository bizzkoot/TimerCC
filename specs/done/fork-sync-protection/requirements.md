# Requirements: Fork Sync Protection System - Researcher Agent

## Meta-Context
- Feature UUID: FEAT-FSP-7A9B2C1D
- Parent Context: TimerCC fork of claude-code with auto-accept-countdown feature
- Stakeholder Map: Fork maintainers (Primary), Contributors (Secondary), End users (Tertiary)
- Market Context: Fork management automation in open source ecosystems

## Stakeholder Analysis

### Primary: Fork Maintainers - Repository Owners/Administrators
**Needs**: Maintain fork synchronization without losing custom features
**Goals**: Seamless upstream integration with feature preservation
**Pain Points**: Manual sync conflicts, feature regression detection, integration complexity

### Secondary: Contributors - Developers Working on Fork
**Needs**: Clear understanding of sync status and safe contribution workflows
**Goals**: Contribute without breaking existing features or sync processes
**Pain Points**: Uncertainty about upstream changes, conflict resolution complexity

### Tertiary: End Users - Auto-Accept-Countdown Feature Users
**Needs**: Reliable feature availability and consistent functionality
**Goals**: Uninterrupted access to enhanced Claude Code experience
**Pain Points**: Feature breakage during updates, inconsistent behavior

## Functional Requirements

### REQ-FSP-001: Automated Fork Status Monitoring
Intent Vector: Continuous awareness of fork divergence and upstream changes
As a fork maintainer I want automated monitoring of upstream changes So that I can proactively manage sync conflicts

Business Value: 9 | Complexity: M | Priority: P0

Acceptance Criteria:
- AC-FSP-001-01: GIVEN upstream repository has new commits WHEN monitoring runs THEN fork status is detected and reported {confidence: 95%}
- AC-FSP-001-02: GIVEN fork has diverged from upstream WHEN check runs THEN ahead/behind commit counts are accurate {confidence: 98%}
- AC-FSP-001-03: GIVEN scheduled monitoring WHEN executed twice daily THEN status reports are generated consistently {confidence: 90%}

Edge Cases: Network failures, authentication issues, upstream repository changes
Market Validation: Standard practice in major fork maintenance workflows (GitLab, Bitbucket)
Risk Factors: GitHub API rate limits, authentication token expiration

### REQ-FSP-002: Auto-Accept-Countdown Feature Protection
Intent Vector: Preserve custom feature integrity during upstream synchronization
As a fork maintainer I want protection of auto-accept-countdown feature So that upstream merges don't break our custom functionality

Business Value: 10 | Complexity: L | Priority: P0

Acceptance Criteria:
- AC-FSP-002-01: GIVEN upstream changes to auto-accept-countdown directory WHEN sync occurs THEN conflicts are detected and reported {confidence: 99%}
- AC-FSP-002-02: GIVEN feature integrity check WHEN critical files are missing THEN workflow fails with clear error message {confidence: 99%}
- AC-FSP-002-03: GIVEN fork-specific URLs in documentation WHEN validation runs THEN proper fork references are verified {confidence: 95%}

Edge Cases: Partial file modifications, indirect dependency changes, configuration conflicts
Market Validation: Feature-preserving merge strategies are industry standard
Risk Factors: Upstream refactoring affecting feature dependencies

### REQ-FSP-003: Safe Merge Simulation
Intent Vector: Validate merge feasibility before actual integration
As a fork maintainer I want merge simulation testing So that I can identify conflicts before they impact the main branch

Business Value: 8 | Complexity: M | Priority: P1

Acceptance Criteria:
- AC-FSP-003-01: GIVEN pending upstream changes WHEN simulation runs THEN merge conflicts are identified without affecting main branch {confidence: 92%}
- AC-FSP-003-02: GIVEN successful simulation WHEN actual merge occurs THEN no unexpected conflicts arise {confidence: 85%}
- AC-FSP-003-03: GIVEN failed simulation WHEN reported THEN specific conflict areas are identified for manual resolution {confidence: 88%}

Edge Cases: Complex three-way merges, binary file conflicts, submodule changes
Market Validation: Pre-merge validation is standard in CI/CD pipelines
Risk Factors: Simulation environment differences from actual merge context

### REQ-FSP-004: Comprehensive Status Reporting
Intent Vector: Clear visibility into fork health and sync recommendations
As a contributor I want detailed sync status reports So that I understand the current state and required actions

Business Value: 7 | Complexity: S | Priority: P1

Acceptance Criteria:
- AC-FSP-004-01: GIVEN fork status check completion WHEN report is generated THEN all key metrics are included in structured format {confidence: 98%}
- AC-FSP-004-02: GIVEN sync issues detected WHEN recommendations are provided THEN actionable steps are clear and specific {confidence: 90%}
- AC-FSP-004-03: GIVEN GitHub Actions integration WHEN workflow completes THEN summary is visible in GitHub interface {confidence: 95%}

Edge Cases: Partial data availability, report generation failures, display formatting issues
Market Validation: Dashboard-style reporting common in DevOps tools
Risk Factors: GitHub Actions summary limitations, markdown rendering variations

### REQ-FSP-005: Automated Safe Merging
Intent Vector: Automatically integrate non-conflicting upstream changes without manual intervention
As a fork maintainer I want automated merging of safe upstream changes So that the fork stays current without manual overhead

Business Value: 8 | Complexity: L | Priority: P1

Acceptance Criteria:
- AC-FSP-005-01: GIVEN upstream changes with no conflicts to auto-accept-countdown WHEN auto-merge runs THEN changes are integrated automatically {confidence: 90%}
- AC-FSP-005-02: GIVEN successful merge simulation WHEN no feature conflicts detected THEN merge proceeds without manual approval {confidence: 88%}
- AC-FSP-005-03: GIVEN automatic merge completion WHEN pushed to main THEN commit message includes upstream reference and validation status {confidence: 95%}

Edge Cases: False positive conflict detection, network failures during merge, authentication issues
Market Validation: Auto-merge workflows standard in dependency management (Dependabot, Renovate)
Risk Factors: Undetected breaking changes, merge commit complexity

### REQ-FSP-006: Complex Change Pull Request Generation
Intent Vector: Manual review workflow for potentially breaking upstream changes
As a fork maintainer I want automatic PR creation for complex changes So that I can review potentially breaking updates before integration

Business Value: 9 | Complexity: M | Priority: P1

Acceptance Criteria:
- AC-FSP-006-01: GIVEN upstream changes affecting auto-accept-countdown dependencies WHEN detected THEN pull request is created with detailed analysis {confidence: 92%}
- AC-FSP-006-02: GIVEN complex merge conflicts WHEN PR is generated THEN specific conflict areas and resolution suggestions are included {confidence: 85%}
- AC-FSP-006-03: GIVEN PR creation WHEN upstream changes are significant THEN impact assessment and testing recommendations are provided {confidence: 88%}

Edge Cases: Multiple dependency changes, circular dependencies, configuration conflicts
Market Validation: Automated PR generation common in major DevOps platforms
Risk Factors: PR description quality, reviewer notification complexity

## Non-functional Requirements

- NFR-FSP-PERF-001: Fork status checks complete within 2 minutes for repositories up to 10K commits
- NFR-FSP-SEC-001: Use read-only GitHub token permissions with no repository write access
- NFR-FSP-UX-001: Status reports achieve 95% clarity score in user comprehension testing
- NFR-FSP-SCALE-001: Support repositories with up to 50MB auto-accept-countdown feature directory
- NFR-FSP-MAINT-001: Workflow configuration follows GitHub Actions best practices and security guidelines

## Research Context Transfer

**Key Decisions**: 
- Prioritized feature protection over automatic merging to prevent data loss
- Chose GitHub Actions for CI integration due to native repository access
- Emphasized simulation-based validation to reduce merge risk

**Open Questions RESOLVED**: 
- Should automatic merging be implemented for non-conflicting changes? → **YES** - Implement auto-merge for safe changes
- How to handle complex dependency changes affecting the countdown feature? → **Generate Pull-Request with details** - Manual review required
- Integration with external notification systems (Slack, email)? → **No need** - GitHub native notifications sufficient

**Context Compression**: 
Fork sync protection system ensures TimerCC fork maintains auto-accept-countdown feature integrity while staying synchronized with upstream claude-code repository through automated monitoring, conflict detection, and safe merge validation workflows.
