- **Needs**: Learning safety net while building confidence with AI assistance
- **Goals**: Gradual transition from manual to automated workflows
- **Pain Points**: Fear of accidental destructive operations, need for controllable automation, varying comfort levels with AI assistance

### Tertiary: Team Leads & DevOps Engineers
- **Needs**: Standardized team workflows, configurable safety parameters
- **Goals**: Consistent development practices across team members
- **Pain Points**: Different comfort levels with automation across team members, need for risk management controls

## Functional Requirements

### REQ-AC-CT-001: Configurable Auto-Accept Countdown
Intent Vector: Provide users with a safety buffer during auto-accept mode before each automatic execution
As a **Claude Code user** I want **a countdown timer before each auto-accept execution when auto-accept mode is enabled** So that **I have time to cancel individual actions and feel safe using automated workflows**
Business Value: 8 | Complexity: M | Priority: P1

Acceptance Criteria:
- AC-AC-CT-001-01: GIVEN auto-accept mode is enabled AND countdown is configured WHEN Claude presents an action for acceptance THEN system shows countdown before auto-accepting {confidence: 95%}
- AC-AC-CT-001-02: GIVEN countdown is active WHEN user presses ESC THEN countdown cancels and that specific action requires manual acceptance {confidence: 98%}
- AC-AC-CT-001-03: GIVEN countdown completes WHEN no cancellation occurs THEN the action is auto-accepted and auto-accept mode continues for next actions {confidence: 97%}

Edge Cases: [Countdown during existing auto-accept session, multiple rapid toggles, system interruption during countdown]
Market Validation: [Addresses common user feedback about auto-accept safety concerns]
Risk Factors: {UI complexity increase, potential for user confusion about auto-accept state}

### REQ-AC-CT-002: Command-Based Timer Configuration
Intent Vector: Enable easy runtime configuration of countdown duration through familiar slash commands
As a **developer** I want **to use `/timer` or `/countdown` commands to set the countdown duration** So that **I can adjust timing based on my current workflow needs without editing config files**
Business Value: 7 | Complexity: S | Priority: P1

Acceptance Criteria:
- AC-AC-CT-002-01: GIVEN user types `/timer 10` WHEN command is executed THEN countdown duration is set to 10 seconds {confidence: 99%}
- AC-AC-CT-002-02: GIVEN user types `/countdown 5` WHEN command is executed THEN countdown duration is set to 5 seconds {confidence: 99%}
- AC-AC-CT-002-03: GIVEN user types `/timer` without value WHEN command is executed THEN current timer setting is displayed {confidence: 95%}
- AC-AC-CT-002-04: GIVEN user types `/timer 0` WHEN command is executed THEN auto-accept activates immediately without countdown {confidence: 98%}
- AC-AC-CT-002-05: GIVEN user types `/timer 65` WHEN command is executed THEN system shows error and maintains current setting (max 60 seconds) {confidence: 97%}

Edge Cases: [Invalid time values, negative values, extremely large values, decimal values]
Market Validation: [Follows established Claude Code slash command patterns]
Risk Factors: {Command namespace collision, input validation complexity}

### REQ-AC-CT-003: Visual Countdown Feedback
Intent Vector: Provide clear visual indication of countdown status and remaining time
As a **user** I want **to see the countdown timer in progress** So that **I know exactly when auto-accept will activate and can make informed decisions about cancellation**
Business Value: 9 | Complexity: M | Priority: P0

Acceptance Criteria:
- AC-AC-CT-003-01: GIVEN countdown is active WHEN timer is running THEN visual display shows remaining seconds with 1-second precision {confidence: 90%}
- AC-AC-CT-003-02: GIVEN countdown reaches 0 WHEN auto-accept activates THEN visual indicator changes to show active auto-accept state {confidence: 92%}
- AC-AC-CT-003-03: GIVEN countdown is cancelled WHEN ESC is pressed THEN visual indicator immediately updates to show cancelled state {confidence: 95%}

Edge Cases: [Terminal resize during countdown, color-blind accessibility, terminal with limited color support]
Market Validation: [Critical for user trust and safety perception]
Risk Factors: {Terminal compatibility issues, visual clutter in interface}

### REQ-AC-CT-004: Countdown Cancellation Control
Intent Vector: Maintain user control during countdown period with familiar interruption patterns
As a **user** I want **to cancel the countdown using ESC key** So that **I can abort auto-accept activation if I realize I triggered it accidentally**
Business Value: 10 | Complexity: S | Priority: P0

Acceptance Criteria:
- AC-AC-CT-004-01: GIVEN countdown is in progress WHEN user presses ESC THEN countdown immediately stops and auto-accept remains disabled {confidence: 98%}
- AC-AC-CT-004-02: GIVEN countdown is cancelled WHEN cancellation completes THEN system returns to manual acceptance mode {confidence: 99%}
- AC-AC-CT-004-03: GIVEN ESC is pressed WHEN countdown is not active THEN existing ESC behavior is preserved {confidence: 100%}

Edge Cases: [Multiple ESC presses, ESC during transition states, concurrent ESC handling]
Market Validation: [Maintains consistency with existing Claude Code ESC patterns]
Risk Factors: {ESC key handling conflicts, timing race conditions}

### REQ-AC-CT-005: Persistent Configuration Storage
Intent Vector: Maintain user preferences across sessions through existing configuration system
As a **developer** I want **my countdown timer settings to persist between Claude Code sessions** So that **I don't have to reconfigure my preferred timing every time I start working**
Business Value: 6 | Complexity: XS | Priority: P2

Acceptance Criteria:
- AC-AC-CT-005-01: GIVEN user sets timer value WHEN Claude Code restarts THEN timer setting is preserved from previous session {confidence: 95%}
- AC-AC-CT-005-02: GIVEN timer setting is stored WHEN `.claude/settings.json` is accessed THEN timer value appears in configuration {confidence: 98%}
- AC-AC-CT-005-03: GIVEN invalid timer value in config WHEN Claude Code starts THEN fallback to default timer value with warning {confidence: 90%}

Edge Cases: [Corrupted config file, permission issues with settings file, concurrent settings modifications]
Market Validation: [Follows existing Claude Code configuration patterns]
Risk Factors: {Settings migration issues, configuration validation complexity}

## Non-functional Requirements

- NFR-AC-CT-PERF-001: Countdown timer must update with 100ms precision and maintain smooth visual feedback without impacting Claude Code's core performance (target: <1ms overhead per update cycle)
- NFR-AC-CT-UX-001: Timer configuration and countdown display must follow existing Claude Code UI patterns (ESC cancellation consistency, visual consistency with existing status indicators, accessibility compliance)
- NFR-AC-CT-COMPAT-001: Timer settings must integrate seamlessly with existing `.claude/settings.json` configuration system and maintain backward compatibility (zero breaking changes to existing config)
- NFR-AC-CT-MAINT-001: Feature must follow existing command architecture patterns in `.claude/commands/` and leverage existing timeout infrastructure (code reuse >60%, consistent with existing patterns)
- NFR-AC-CT-SEC-001: Timer functionality must not introduce security vulnerabilities or bypass existing permission systems (security audit compliance, no privilege escalation)

## Research Context Transfer

**Key Decisions**: 
- Prioritized safety (P0) over convenience features based on stakeholder analysis showing safety concerns as primary adoption barrier
- Chose dual command approach (`/timer` and `/countdown`) to accommodate different user mental models
- Integrated with existing ESC cancellation patterns to maintain UI consistency

**Architectural Decisions Resolved**:
- **UI Placement**: Countdown display will be positioned at the bottom section, outside dialog box, on the left side
- **Auto-Accept Integration**: Timer will be ENABLED when auto-accept mode is active (Shift+Tab on); timer is disabled when auto-accept is off (manual mode)
- **Timer Range**: Default value of 5 seconds, configurable range 0-60 seconds (0 seconds = immediate activation)
- **Time Units**: Seconds only (no support for minutes/hours to maintain simplicity)

**Context Compression for Next Phase**:
- **Core Value**: Safety buffer for auto-accept with minimal workflow disruption
- **Technical Constraints**: Must leverage existing timeout infrastructure and configuration system
- **User Experience**: Visual countdown with ESC cancellation following established patterns
- **Priority**: Safety features (visual feedback, cancellation) are P0, convenience features (persistence) are P2
